pietorch, openaai, tensorflow library

overlap of time series forcasting , computer vision and nlp is video steaming

CNN : Convonutional neural Network, ideal architecture to process the image 
usually it is combination of 3 -  Lu, pooling and convonutional

hyper parameter tuning : Keras libraby 

how many parameter we can cha nge in a simple model
